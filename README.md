# Password_Vault_CLI
    A simple console application for storing all your passwords to an encrypted json file.
    
# Simple to use:
    You can use this program to store all your passwords locally and (most importantly) encrypted.

# Security:
    The data are been encrypted with a 44 alphanumeric key. 
    One part of the key is stored the vault, but without the second part it is useless amd cannot decrypt your data.
    The second part is the one you have. 
    It can be between 7 and 44 digits depending on how many you want to remeber (the more the better the security).

# WARNING!
    If you forget or lose your part of the key then the file becomes useless!
    You cannot retrieve your data until you find it.
    The longer the part you choose to memorise the safer your vault is against brute forcing. 

# DISCLAIMER
    This program was made as part of a Python exercise for my students and is not by any means a replacement for a password manager.
